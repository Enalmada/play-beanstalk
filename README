# play-beanstalk 

AWS Beanstalk is one of the easiest ways to get you app up production ready:
 - no downtime deployments
 - time/load based server autoscaling
 - automatic reloads on environment variable changes
 - automatic version rollbacks when there are release health problems
 - ssl using your uploaded cert with one click


#### Version information
play-beanstalk is built and tested with play 2.4 but the principles apply to other versions.

## Quickstart

-- Create beanstalk web environment using sample image (no rds database).
   If beanstalk fails on initial image it can get stuck, better to overwrite healthy sample with your initial build file.

-- Create an s3 bucket to hold your build files.  Give access to your beanstalk role for this bucket.
   You can just give the role full readonly permission as an easy test.  Production should lock it down to bucket readonly.

-- Edit manual_release.sh with your application name, bucket name, environment name.
   Run "./manual_release.sh initial" to push initial build to s3, create beanstalk version, use version

Optional:
=================================

Connect to a database
   Create RDS database manually using your preferred settings.  Make sure security group matches beanstalk.
   Uncomment
   Update beanstalk/.ebextensions/bootstrap_env.config > DB_URL with the correct jdbc url.

Setup continuous deployment
   Check this code into Git or Bitbucket.  I use Bitbucket because it has free private repo.
   Git/Bitbucket specifically interface with shippable.com.
   Create a shippable.com account.  It is free, docker friendly, and faster build than others.  Note the shippable.yml in the root.
   But you could use any modern build provider:

   Edit shippable.yml with your aws keys, bucketname, application name, environment name
   You will need to go into project settings and encrypt this: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your secret key here> for the secret area

Setup log aggregation
   The idea behind beanstalk is that you should never have to login to machine directly.
   Although beanstalk has some basic manual logging retevial, you are going to want to use a 3rd party logging solution.
   I recommend Sumologic account.  Genarate accesskey/accessid and put it in .ebextensions/sumo_logic.config
   SumoLogic has a free tier and aggregate logging, query, alerting make it very valuable.

Setup server monitoring
   Beanstalk gives you basic server monitoring and health but New Relic takes monitoring to the next level.
   Create New Relic account.  Put your license key in newrelic.conf.  This will handle server monitoring, can be more convenient to use.
   It has separate server and app monitoring software with a free tier.

Setup ssl
   Get a free ssl key with https://letsencrypt.org.  Upload it to aws.  Select it in loadbalancing section of configuration.
